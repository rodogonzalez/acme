you should setup a virtual host or host this laravel code into a server,

it requires also execute some laravels artisan commands as 
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed 

the authentications are used by the defautl handlers,

remember setup the file .env with the correct access to your database of election, in my case I used MySQL, but as it is on laravel it uses a agnostic db schema.
